MacOS Ignitiond BUILD NOTES
===========================
**See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building Ignition QT, the graphical user interface.**

**Tested on MacOS Mojave 10.14.2 - Darwin Kernel Version 17.3.0.  PPC is not supported because it's big-endian.**

All of the commands should be executed in Terminal.app.. it's in
/Applications/Utilities

You need to install XCode with all the options checked so that the compiler and everything is available in /usr not just /Developer I think it comes on the DVD but you can get the current version from http://developer.apple.com

1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

git clone https://github.com/ignitioncoin/ignitioncoin

2.  Install XCode and it's command line tools

3.  Download and install Homebrew using instructions from https://brew.sh/

4.  Install dependencies from Homebrew

    `brew install qt autoconf automake libtool boost@1.59 berkeley-db@4 openssl miniupnpc gmp`

* Optionally install qrencode 
(and use USE_QRCODE=1 when building the binary. Example: `make -f makefile.osx USE_QRCODE=1`):

    `brew install qrencode`

5. In a separate terminal window type in `ls -td -- /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/* | head -n 1` and copy the
version number after /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/ (in this example we'll use /usr/local/Cellar/openssl/**1.0.2q**)

6. Open up `src/makefile.osx` and under `INCLUDEPATHS` replace the openssl version 
with the one copied in **Step 5** (`1.0.2q`). The line should now read:
`-I"$(DEPSDIR)/Cellar/openssl/1.0.2q/include"`

7.  Now you should be able to build Ignitiond:
    ```
    cd Ignition/src
    make -f makefile.osx
    ```
#### Other Ignitiond commands
    Run:
      `./Ignitiond --help  # for a list of command-line options.`
    Run
      `./Ignitiond -daemon # to start the Ignition daemon.`
    Run
      `./Ignitiond help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands`
