:::: Upgrading on Ubuntu / Debian Linux Distributions ::::

Your default data directory is ~/.Ignition - This folder contains your wallet*, the chain data, and your configuration files
To backup and clean this folder, do this:
`cd ~/.Ignition`

You will now be in the data directory. From here, you want to copy out your wallet and important files.
First, make a backup folder,
`mkdir ~/ignitionbackup`

Then, copy the important files to your backup:
`cp wallet.dat ~/ignitionbackup && cp *.conf ~/ignitionbackup`

Now, you can delete the data directory,
`cd ~/ && rm -r ~/.Ignition`

The folder that contained your data is now deleted. Now, you can compile IgnitionCoin like usual,
`mkdir ~/ignitioncoinsource && cd ~/ignitioncoinsource && git clone https://github.com/ignitioncoin/ignitioncoin && cd ignitioncoin/src && make -f makefile.unix`

Then, you want to copy your compiled ignitiond from ~/ignitioncoinsource/ignitioncoin/bin to /usr/local/bin, make sure you remove it if it was already there first, by doing:
`sudo rm /usr/local/bin/ignitiond && cp ~/ignitioncoinsource/ignitioncoin/bin/ignitiond /usr/local/bin`

Once it is compiled and installed, you can then restore the data directory. Run ignitiond to initialize the directory,
`ignitiond`

Then, copy the backed up wallet and configuration files into the new data directory, with:
`cp ~/ignitionbackup/* ~/.Ignition`

Now, run ignitiond again, and your all set , with old wallet and configurations. Just wait for sync and your upgraded!
